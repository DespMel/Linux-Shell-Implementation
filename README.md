# Linux-Shell-Implementation
Implemented a shell that imitates the Linux shell. It shows a prompt, reads the command line and creates the processes in order to execute the command. Our shell could execute commands like "ls", "ls -l" etc, support I/O redirections and pipelines. 
Worked with: C, gedit editor on Ubuntu OS which was installed on Oracle VM VirtualBox.
